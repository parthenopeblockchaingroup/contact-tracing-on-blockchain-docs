# Contact Tracing on Blockchain
This repository contains documents regarding a proposal for a contact tracing (or proximity tracing) system based on blockchain technology. The proposed model aims to offer a decentralized solution where the backend is public and auditable in real-time. The goal would be to help slow down the spread of the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 being at the same time concerned with people's privacy.

# Implementation
An open source implementation for the smart contract described in the document is available at [parthenopeblockchaingroup/contact-tracing-on-blockchain-contracts](https://github.com/parthenopeblockchaingroup/contact-tracing-on-blockchain-contracts)

# Contributing
The project is open for contributions.
