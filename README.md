# Contact Tracing on Blockchain
This repository contains documents regarding a proposal for a contact tracing (or proximity tracing) system based on blockchain technology. The proposed model aims to offer a decentralized solution where the backend is public and auditable in real-time. The goal would be to help slow down the spread of the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 being at the same time concerned with people's privacy.
